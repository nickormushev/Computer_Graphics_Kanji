# Computer Graphics Kanji
This is my homework for university. I created a Kanji with three.js. During the process of making the Kanji I learned how to create custom geometries and also how to use Shape and the ExtrudeGeometry which made my job a whole lot easier. I haven't reworked the whole project to use them.
